# On Inherited Popularity Bias in Cold-Start Item Recommendation
This repository contains code and resources for the RecSys 2025 short paper submission "On Inherited Popularity Bias in Cold-Start Item Recommendation". The model implementations and setup were based on the [ColdRec](https://github.com/YuanchenBei/ColdRec) repository, with adjustments made to model code to improve performance and align more closely with the original implementations by the authors. To facilitiate reproducibility, we include the final post-tuning [hyperparameter settings](https://github.com/RecAnon/Cold-PopBias/blob/main/src/hyperparams.yml) used to produce the results in the paper for each model on each dataset. The full repository including utility and data classes will be made available upon acceptance.

We also upload the [supplementary material document](https://github.com/RecAnon/Cold-PopBias/blob/main/ColdPopBias_SupplementaryMaterial.pdf) referenced in the paper, which includes detailed dataset information and figures which augment the case study and magnitude scaling analysis from the main paper.
